* Ethernet cable with supplied rubber grommet (PoE models)
* Microsoft Azure account with Blob Storage

Installation
------------

1. Connect camera to PoE switch using supplied ethernet cable (or USB power for WiFi models)
2. **Important:** Use the rubber grommet to protect ethernet connection from moisture (PoE models)
3. Camera will automatically get IP address via DHCP
4. Hostname will be the camera's serial number (e.g., ``e438191ae89e``)

.. warning::
   Always use the supplied rubber grommet for moisture protection, especially outdoors.

Accessing the Camera Web Interface
===================================

Changing the Default Password
-----------------------------

Method 1 - With DHCP (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check your router's web interface for connected devices
2. Look for device with hostname matching camera serial number (e.g., ``e438191ae89e``)
3. Open web browser and navigate to that IP address
4. Login with username ``root`` and default password ``e438191ae89e``. 
5. Change the password under  **System** ‚Üí **Administration** in the top menu.

Method 2 - Without DHCP (Direct Connection)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Set your computer IP to ``192.168.123.251``
2. Set subnet mask to ``255.255.255.0``
3. Leave gateway and DNS empty
4. Navigate to ``192.168.123.250`` in web browser
5. Login with username ``root`` and default password ``e438191ae89e``.
